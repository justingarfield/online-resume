# Overview

This reposistory houses my personal online resume at https://resume.jgarfield.com

It's intended to stay extremely simple and consist of only a single page.

I keep this separate from my main static site repository, as it uses a different layout and format compared to my other sites and pages.

# Simply serve with http.server

With such a simple page, I don't both with any hot-reloading or dynamic content here. Just serve the single `index.html` file however you like.

```shell
python3 -m http.server
```
